[~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/k21/.rustscan.toml"
[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers

And lots of things in directory busting.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309121509.png)

And the directories and queries from robots.txt in not valid.

```
admin/config/development/configuration/sync
```

We can use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to dump data and file from .git directory.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250309122744.png)

`BackDropJ2024DS2024`

```
$database = 'mysql://root:BackDropJ2024DS2024@127.0.0.1/backdrop';
$database_prefix = '';

```


And can find email.
`0-8204779c764abd4c9d8d95038b6d22b6a7515afa/files/config_83dddd18e1ec67fd8ff5bba2453c7fb3/active/update.settings.json`
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309140603.png)

And we logged in.

## Exploit

![](Pasted%20image%2020250309144948.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309145207.png)

Now,
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309153823.png)

And we need to create a shell.tar.gz.

[exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52021)

It will create a shell directory.
We need to do.
`tar -czvf shell.tar.gz shell/`

And upload this tar.gz file in the thing uploading module.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309154248.png)

And now after doing that we need to load that.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309154328.png)

and visit what exploit saying or `/modules/shell/shell.php`

And we will see this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309154145.png)

And now we can use python3 reverse shell to get stable shell.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309154500.png)

## Privelege Escalation

Lets enumerate.
Now we can login to mysql server.
But it was a rabbithole.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309154948.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309155414.png)

`hashcat -m 7900 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force`

Nothing here and we cant even crack the password of user.

And amazingly, we can use same password from before for user `johncusack`.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309161007.png)

And now doing `sudo -l` revealed this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309162543.png)

And doing this came this.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309162621.png)

So its a command to manage that backdrop cms.
But we have root priveleges.
And we can see it can use eval function of php.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309162757.png)

So Now we can try to do privelege escalate using eval.

Lets try.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309163256.png)

Hmm and after doing some talk with chatGPT,if we specify the `root directory of the Backdrop installation to use`,we could do so.
`sudo -u root /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html eval 'system(whoami)'
`
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309163814.png)
I guess it worked.

Lets try.
We have to also write commands inside quotations. 
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309163909.png)

```
sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html eval 'system("/bin/bash");'

```

and we got the root.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309164104.png)

## Done

And done.
![](Pasted%20image%2020250309164152.png)

Again lots of things learned.
I hope you enjoyed.
